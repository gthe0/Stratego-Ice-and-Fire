# Stratego MVC Project
Welcome to the Stratego MVC Project! This repository contains the code and resources for a college assignment of an OOP course using Java. It focuses on teaching the MVC design pattern ,through a simple implementation of  **Stratego: Fire & Ice** variant.

## Overview
This Project was written for a college assignment, under fair-use, for educational purposes in which we had to:
+ Use the Swing legacy library
+ Implement it using the MVC design pattern.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using either the GitHub Desktop app or by using the following command:
```console 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/college-assignment.git
```

## Compilation
To compile the game, I recomend that you download an IDE like _IntelliJ IDEA_ or _Eclipse_.
They also come bundled with the **Eclipse compiler** and a JRE.

This project was written to run in Java 8, but you should not have any problems compiling it for newer versions of Java because it's backwards compatible.

## Usage
To run the game, after compilation, you can either press the Run Button of the IDE of your choice or create an executable.
